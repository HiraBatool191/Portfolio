        "This project is a complete e-commerce store built with JavaScript (React) that uses a mock/fake API to simulate backend functionality. Users can register and log in, browse a product catalog, view product details, and add items to their cart; each user’s cart is persisted (using the mock API/local storage) so their added items remain saved across sessions. The app includes full cart management—update quantities, remove items, and view cart totals—and a simulated checkout flow and validation. Because the backend is mocked, the project demonstrates realistic API interactions (fetching products, user authentication, and per-user cart storage) while remaining ideal for testing and rapid prototyping. The UI is responsive and focuses on clear state management, error handling, and a smooth user experience where different users can log in to their own accounts and maintain separate carts.",
